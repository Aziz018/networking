# chapter 1: Fundamentals

## Definitions:

### Computer network:

- A `computer network` is a set of `nodes` connected by `communication links`, or A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate with each other to share resources and information. These devices can include computers, servers, smartphones, and other digital equipment.

- A `node` can be a computer printer or any other device capable of sending or receiving data.

- A `communication link` refers to a physical (wired) or virtual (wireless) connection that enables communication between two or more devices or entities in a network.

- `End devices` are devices that originate or consume data within a network. They are the final destination or source of data transmission.

- `Intermediary devices` are network devices that facilitate communication between end devices and ensure data is transferred efficiently across the network.

## Basic characteristics any computer network:

### Fault tolerance

- `Fault tolerance` is the capability of a network to continue operating correctly even when one or more of its components fail.
Fault tolerance is Ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.

### Scalability

- `Scalability` is the ability of a network to grow and handle an increasing amount of work or accommodate expansion without compromising performance.

### Quality of Service

- `Quality of Service` refers to the set of technologies and policies used to manage and prioritize network traffic to ensure the performance of critical applications.

### Security

- `Security` involves protecting the network and its data from unauthorized access, attacks, and other threats to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Network Protocols & Communications:

### Data communication:

- `Data communications` are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of `link` or `transmission medium` sush as cable.

### Data transmission:

- `Data transmission` also known as `data flow`, refers to the process of sending data from one point to another through a communication channel. It involves the movement of data between devices

#### -> Data Transmission Modes:

- Simplex: Data flows in one direction only (e.g., TV broadcast).
- Half-Duplex: Data flows in both directions, but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkies).
- Full-Duplex: Data flows in both directions simultaneously (e.g., telephone conversations).

### Network Protocols:

- `Protocols` are a sets of rules that define (govern) how data is transmitted and received over a network. They ensure that devices on a network can communicate effectively.

#### The elements of a protocol:

1) Message Encoding:

- Definition: Message encoding specifies how data is converted into a format suitable for transmission. A source message from the sender is encoded into signals or waves then transmitted through a medium wired/wireless then received and decoded and the message is passed to the destination.
- Purpose: Ensures that data can be correctly interpreted by the receiving device.
- Example: Converting text characters into binary code using encoding schemes like ASCII or UTF-8.

2) Message Formatting and Encapsulation:

- Definition: Formatting and encapsulation involve structuring the data into packets or frames and adding protocol-specific headers and trailers.
- Purpose: Organizes data for efficient transmission and includes control information for routing and error checking.
- Example: An IP packet includes a header with source and destination IP addresses, while an Ethernet frame includes MAC addresses.

3) Message Timing:

- Definition: Message timing refers to the synchronization and timing rules for data transmission.
- Purpose: Ensures coordinated data exchange between sender and receiver, preventing collisions and ensuring efficient use of network resources.
- Example: TCP uses timing mechanisms to manage data flow and retransmissions, ensuring reliable communication.


4) Message Size:

- Definition: Message size defines the maximum size of data packets or frames that can be transmitted.
- Purpose: Ensures compatibility with network hardware and protocols, and optimizes data transfer efficiency.
- Example: Ethernet frames typically have a maximum size of 1500 bytes, known as the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).

5) Message Delivery Options (Transmission Methods):

- These are the various ways data can be transmitted across a network. They include:

    - Unicast: One-to-one communication where data is sent from one sender to one receiver.

        <!-- <img src="./IMG/unicasting.png"/> -->
        <img src="./IMG/Unicast-1024x457.jpg"
    </p>

    - Multicast: One-to-many communication where data is sent from one sender to multiple receivers who have expressed interest in receiving the data.

    <p align="center">
        <!-- <img src="./IMG/multicasting.png"> -->
        <img src="./IMG/Multicast-1024x456.jpg"
    </p>


    - Broadcast: One-to-all communication where data is sent from one sender to all devices within a specific network segment or broadcast domain.
    
    <p align="center">
        <!-- <img src="./IMG/broadcasting.png"> -->
        <img src="./IMG/Broadcast-1024x457.jpg"
    </p>

    - Purpose: Transmission methods determine how data is directed and distributed across the network based on the specific communication needs and the characteristics of the recipients.

Examples:

- Unicast: Sending an email to a specific recipient.
- Multicast: Streaming a live video feed to multiple viewers.
- Broadcast: Broadcasting network discovery packets to all devices on a local network.


### Types of network architectures:

- Peer-to-Peer network:
    - Peer-to-peer (P2P) is defined as a decentralized network architecture in which participants, called peers, interact directly with each other without the need for a central authority or server.
    - In a P2P network, each participant acts as both a client and a server, enabling them to share resources and services directly with other peers.
    - not scalable.
    
    <p align="center">
        <img width="80%" src="./IMG/peer-to-peer.jpg">
    </p>

- Client-Server network:

    - A client-server network is a computing model in which multiple clients connect to a central server to access resources, such as files, applications, and data. The server acts as a central hub, managing and providing services to the connected clients.
    - Request-Response model.
    - Server may be overloaded.
    - Scalable.

## Network Topologies:

- Network topology (layout) is an arragement of a computer network.

> phisical topology: refers to the actual physical layout or arrangement of network devices and cables. It describes how network devices like computers, switches, routers, and other hardware are physically connected and organized in a network.

> logical topology: refers to the way data flows within a network, regardless of its physical design. It describes the path that data travels from one device to another, which may not necessarily align with the physical layout.


1) Bus Topology:

- All devices are connected to a `single central cable`, called the bus or backbone.
- All the data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over the `common transmission medium` and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously
- A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from a source machine in `both directions` to all machine connected to the bus until it find the intended recepient.

- Can change based on the location of the devices.
- Assigned manually or dinamically.
- Represented in decimal and it has 4 octets (x.x.x.x).
- 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (32 bits).

> How to see IP address?

- **Windows:**

1) Using Command Prompt:
- Open Command Prompt (press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter).
- Type the following command:
```cmd
ipconfig
```
2) Using PowerShell:
- Open PowerShell (press Win + X and select Windows PowerShell).
- Type the following command:

```poweshell
Get-NetIPAddress
```

- **Linux and UNIX-like:**
1) Using ifconfig command:
```bash
ifconfig
```
2) Using ip Command:

```bash
ip addr show
# or
ip a
```
3) Using hostname command
```bash
hostname -I
```

## Basic MAC addressing:

- MAC stand for Media Access Control.
- Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address.
- IP Address = Location of a person.
- MAC Address = Name of the person.

<img src="./IMG/2024-07-04_10-00.png">

### MAC address:

- Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address.

- Can not be changed.
- Assigned by the manufacturer.
- Represented in hexadecimal.
- Example: 70-20-84-00-ED-FC (48 bits).
- Separator: hyphen (-), period (.), and colon (:).

### Diffrence between IP and MAC addresses:

<img src="./IMG/2024-07-04_10-10.png">

> How to see MAC address?

- **Windows:**

1) Using Command Prompt:

- Open Command Prompt (press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter).
Type the following command:
```cmd
ipconfig /all
```
- The MAC address will be listed as the `"Physical Address"` for each network interface.

2) Using PowerShell:

- Open PowerShell (press Win + X and select Windows PowerShell).
Type the following command:
```powershell
Get-NetAdapter | select Name, MacAddress
```
3) Using Network Settings:

- Go to Settings > Network & Internet.
Select your network connection (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
- Click on Hardware properties. The MAC address will be listed as the "Physical address (MAC)".

- **Linux and UNUX-like:**

1) Using ip Command:

```bash
ip link show
```

- Look for the `link/ether` entry in the output for each network interface. The MAC address will be in the format `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`.
- Example Output:

```sql
2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:4e:12:8b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.5/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic enp0s3
       valid_lft 86389sec preferred_lft 86389sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe4e:128b/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
- The MAC address here is `08:00:27:4e:12:8b`.
2) Using ifconfig Command:

```bash
ifconfig
```
- Look for the `ether` or `HWaddr` entry in the output for each network interface. The MAC address will be in the format `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`.

## Basic of Port addressing:

### Port address or port number:

- In a node, many processes will be runing.
- Data witch are sent/received must reach the right process.
- Every process in a node is uniquely identified using `port numbers`.
- Port = Communication end point.
- Fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers (0 - 65535).

> Example:

    - fixed port numbers 25 (SMTP), 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH).
    - os assigned dynamic port numbers 62414.

<img src="./IMG/2024-07-05_07-12.png">

> How to see MAC address?

- **Windows:**

- We can use `Resource Monitor` to see port numbers and associated processes.

### 3 key points to ponder:

- Before sending data, any node must

1) Attach source `IP address` and destination `IP address`. (to identified the network) required for routers. <!-- Attach (إرفاق) -->
2) Attach source `MAC address` and destination `MAC address`. (to identified the right host) required for switch (LAN).
3) Attach source `Port number` and destination `Port number`. (to identified the right process from the particular host) required for the OS to handover the data to the right process.

## Switching Techniques in Computer Networks:

### Switching:

- Switching in IT and computer networking is the transfer of data packets, or blocks of data, through a network switch. Switches transfer data from source ports on devices such as computers to destination ports on devices such as routers. helps in deciding the best route for the data transmission if there are multiple paths.

- One-to-One connection.

### Switching techniques:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./IMG/2024-07-05_09-48.png">
</p>

#### Circuit Switching:

- A dedicated path is established between the sender and the receiver.
- Before date transfer, connection will be established first.
- Example: Telephone network.

- There are 3 phases in circuit switching:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./IMG/ezgif.com-animated-gif-maker.gif">
</p>
<!-- 1) connection establishment.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./IMG/2024-07-05_10-43.png">
</p>

2) data transfer.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./IMG/2024-07-05_10-43_1.png">
</p>

3) connection disconnection.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./IMG/2024-07-05_10-44.png">
</p> -->

#### Message Switching:

- Store and forward mechanism.
- Message is transferred as a complete unit and forwarded using store and forward mechanism at the intermediary node.
- Not suited for streaming media and real-time applications.

#### Packet Switching:

- The internet is a packet switched network.
- Message is broken into individual chunks called as packets.
- Each packet is sent individually.
- Each packet will have source and destination IP address with sequence number.
- Sequence numbers will help the receiver to:
    
    - Recorder the packets.
    - Detect mission packets and ... .


1) Datagram Approach
2) Virtual Circuit Approach


## Layering in computer network:

### Definition:

- Layering means decomposing the problem into more manageable components (layers).

### Advantages:

- **It provides more modular design:** By dividing network functionality into distinct layers, each layer can be developed, maintained, and updated independently. This modular approach allows for easier scalability and flexibility in network design. For example, changes in one layer generally do not affect the others, simplifying upgrades and modifications.

- **Easy to toubleshot:** Layering facilitates troubleshooting by isolating issues to specific layers. Problems can often be localized to a particular layer based on where communication breaks down or where errors occur. This division makes it easier for network administrators and engineers to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently without needing to understand every detail of the entire network stack.

### Protocols:

- It is a set of rules that governs data communiction.
- The protocols in each layer governs the activities of the data communication.

### Layered architectures:

- The OSI reference model:

    - OSI stands for `Open System Interconnection`.
    - It is a model for understanding and designing network architecture that is flexible, robust, and interoperable.
    - Developed by the International Standards for Organizations (ISO).
    - The OSI model is not a protocol.
    - It is only a guideline and hence it is referred as OSI reference model.
    - The purpose of the OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the undelying hardware and software.
    - The OSI model was never fully implemented, it is just a guideline.

- The TCP/IP model:

    - TCP/IP it is an acronym of `Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.`
    - The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model.
    - Therefore, the layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match those in the OSI model.
    - TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules each of witch provides a specific functionality.
